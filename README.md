# Student Management System

A production-ready MERN student directory built for a three-tier cloud architecture:

`Browser → Netlify (React/Vite) → Render (Node/Express REST API) → MongoDB Atlas`

The database is never accessed by the browser; React uses HTTPS REST requests to the Express application tier, which alone connects to MongoDB Atlas.

## Features

- Create, view, update, and delete students
- Live search by student ID or name
- Server-side validation for required fields, email, semester (1–12), and duplicate student IDs
- Responsive plain-CSS dashboard with success/error feedback
- Environment-only database and cross-origin configuration

## Technologies

Frontend: React, Vite, Axios, React Hooks, CSS. Backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, dotenv, cors, nodemon. Database: MongoDB Atlas.

## Folder structure

```text
student-management-system/
├── frontend/       # Netlify presentation layer
│   ├── src/        # React UI and api.js

```

## Local installation

Create an Atlas database and database user. In Atlas Network Access, allow your development IP (and later Render). Obtain the connection string and put it in `backend/.env`, created from `.env.example`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Start the API:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Start the client in a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/students` | List students |
| GET | `/api/students/:id` | Get one student |
| POST | `/api/students` | Create student |
| PUT | `/api/students/:id` | Update student |
| DELETE | `/api/students/:id` | Delete student |

Request fields: `studentId`, `name`, `email`, `department`, `semester`, and `contact`. Successful mutations return `{ "success": true, "message": "..." }`.

## MCP Integration

Claude sends Model Context Protocol requests to the backend endpoint on Render. The backend's Express MCP handler uses the existing Student model to read and manage records in MongoDB Atlas:

`Claude → MCP endpoint on Render → Express → MongoDB Atlas`

The MCP server provides these tools:

- `list_students()` — list all students
- `search_students({ query })` — search names and student IDs by case-insensitive partial match
- `get_student({ studentId })` — retrieve one student by student ID
- `add_student({ studentId, name, email, department, semester, contact })` — add a validated student
- `update_student({ studentId, ...fields })` — update a student by student ID
- `delete_student({ studentId })` — delete a student by student ID

Set `MCP_SECRET` in the Render backend environment variables to a long, random secret. The secret is part of the endpoint path and authorizes access:

`https://<render-app>.onrender.com/mcp/<MCP_SECRET>`

In Claude, open **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** and enter the endpoint URL above.

## Deploy to Render

1. Push this project to GitHub and create a Render **Web Service** with `backend` as Root Directory.
2. Set Build Command to `npm install` and Start Command to `npm start`.
3. Add `MONGODB_URI` and `FRONTEND_URL` environment variables. Set `FRONTEND_URL` to the final Netlify site URL exactly (for example, `https://example.netlify.app`). Render provides `PORT`; no hardcoded port is needed.
4. Permit Render access in MongoDB Atlas Network Access (for a coursework demo, Atlas's `0.0.0.0/0` rule is commonly used; secure it appropriately for production).

## Deploy to Netlify

1. Edit `frontend/src/api.js`: replace `http://localhost:5000/api` with `https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com/api`.
2. Create a Netlify site with `frontend` as the base directory.
3. Use Build Command `npm run build` and Publish Directory `dist`.
4. Redeploy Render after setting the Netlify URL in `FRONTEND_URL`.

## Testing

Use the dashboard to add a valid student, edit it, search by name/ID, and delete it. You may also test the REST API with Postman. Confirm invalid email, blank fields, out-of-range semester, and duplicate student ID return JSON errors. After deployment, test only via the Netlify URL to confirm the CORS and three-tier integration.
